## 1.  Profiling with gprof and optimized random number generation

Profiling results from profile_report_gprof.txt revealed that 75% of the execution time was spent on random number generation using the Mersenne Twister engine. While it provides high-quality randomness, it is relatively slow. To improve performance, we replaced it with std::minstd_rand, a faster linear congruential generator that maintains the same accuracy.

After re-running gprof, the time spent on random number generation was reduced from 75% to 15%, significantly improving the efficiency of the Monte Carlo Simulation.

see [Profiling with gprof](optimization_documentation/gprof_Analysis/Profiling_with_gprof.md) for more details.

## 2. Multithreading

### How Our Threading Works
1. Each wallet runs as a separate async task
   - One future per wallet
   - No manual thread management needed
   - System handles thread creation/cleanup

2. Core Structure:
   ```cpp
   std::vector<std::future<void>> futures;
   for (size_t wallet_idx = 0; wallet_idx < wallets.size(); ++wallet_idx) {
       futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, [&, wallet_idx]() {
           // Wallet simulation code
       }));
   }

3. Thread Safety Features
- Mutex protects price trend updates
- Local value calculation before mutex lock
- Safe random number generation per thread

### Why It's Faster Than Non-Threaded
1. Parallel Wallet Processing
   - Multiple wallets simulated simultaneously
   - Each wallet runs independently except for price updates
   - Utilizes multiple CPU cores

2. Efficient Resource Usage
   - Only shared data (price trends) needs mutex protection
   - Most calculations happen in parallel
   - Each wallet has its own local calculations

3. Example Performance:
   - Non-threaded: 4 wallets Ã— 1000 simulations = 4000 sequential simulations
   - Threaded: 4 wallets running 1000 simulations each in parallel
   - Theoretical speedup: Up to 4x with 4 cores


## 3. Memory Alignment
- Code can be found in the [optimization_documentation/QBC_CEC_Analysis](optimization_documentation/QBC_CEC_Analysis) folder.

- *Idea: data types must be aligned with words or half words.* ([Lecture 11, slide 19](https://www.moodle.tum.de/pluginfile.php/5191043/mod_resource/content/6/advprog-lecture-optimization.pdf))

We evaluated the size of occpuied memory, the number of cachelines and number of holes for each class with the help of the [Compiler Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/). The codes which we used for these evaluations can be found in folder "optimization_documentation".

After reducing the size of occupied memory and eliminating holes where needed, we checked for each class whether the efficiency of the CPU time has increased or not. We used [Quick C++ Benchmark](https://quick-bench.com/q/r57JfkRd8B9x9fIWL_MHh0H_GqY) for evaluation. The result of the evaluation are shown in figures for each class.

### Stock class

- Doubles were changed into floats (half of size in memory, loss of precision and size of value is not crucial).
- The order of members was changed to eliminate holes and reduce the number of cachelines.
- Name was moved into chacline 2, because it's accesed less frequently than other members.

};
```

### 2. Wallet

- Use of int for identification instead of a string (former name).
- The order of members was changed to bring the unordered list and the double into cacheline 1 and have Strategy and the int in cachleine 2.
(- The double will not be changed into float if other classes are not optimized. Interaction between Wallet and other classes would result in float and double conversions.)

# 4. Other Optimizaion Techniques in Market Simulator

## 1. **Precalculation Enhancements**
- **Volatility Adjustment**: The volatility adjustment process is now executed before running the simulation, significantly improving efficiency. Previously, volatility was recalculated during each simulation iteration, leading to redundancy. The following is now precomputed:

  ```cpp
  double daily_mean = stock.annual_return() / 252.0;
  double daily_vol = stock.annual_volatility() / sqrt(252.0);
  ```

  **Optimized Approach**: The necessary values are now precomputed in a more efficient manner by looping over the stocks:

  ```cpp
  for (auto& stock : stocks) {
      double total_stock_shares = total_shares[stock.name()];

      if (total_stock_shares > 0) {
          double base_coefficient{0.1};
          double adjustment_factor = 1.0 + base_coefficient * log(1.0 + total_stock_shares);
          stock.set_updated_annual_volatility(adjustment_factor);
      }
      stock.set_daily_mean_return();
      stock.set_daily_vol();
      stock.set_distribution(stock.daily_mean_return(), stock.daily_vol());
  }
  return 0;
  ```

  These updates were integrated into the `preparation` function in `MarketSimulator.cpp` within the `adjust_volatility` function. Additionally, unnecessary nested loops were replaced with more efficient data structures.

- **Optimized Risk Level Calculation**: The redundant loop for risk level calculation is now executed only once in the stock class constructor, reducing unnecessary computations:

  ```cpp
  void Stock::calculate_risk_level(const double& variance, int stock_counter[3]) {
      // 1: low risk, 2: medium risk, 3: high risk
      if (variance < 0.3) {
          _risk_level = 1;
          stock_counter[0]++;
      } 
      else if(variance < 0.6) {
          _risk_level = 2;
          stock_counter[1]++;
      }
      else {
          _risk_level = 3;
          stock_counter[2]++;
      }
  }
  ```

## 2. **Loop Unrolling and Efficiency Improvements**

- **Current Prices Initialization**: The initialization of `current_prices` has been optimized by removing redundant iterations.

  **Previous Approach**:
  ```cpp
  for (size_t i = 0; i < stocks.size(); ++i) {
      current_prices[i] = stocks[i].initial_value();
  }
  ```

  **Optimized Approach**: The stock price trend is now initialized within the stock object itself, reducing memory usage and eliminating unnecessary loops:

  ```cpp
  _name(name), _ann_return(ann_return), _ann_volatility(ann_volatility), 
  _risk_level(risk_level), _init_value(init_value), _price_trend(price_trend) {
      if (_price_trend.empty()) {
          _price_trend.push_back(_init_value);
      }
  }
  ```

  The stock class now automatically updates its price trend, avoiding the need for additional loops.

- **Stock Allocation Optimization**: Stock allocation calculations are now performed more efficiently by creating the stock objects in a single loop within `main.cpp`:

  **Previous Approach**:
  ```cpp
  for (auto& wallet : wallets) {
      total_initial_investment += wallet.initial_investment();
      for (auto& stock : stocks) {
          double allocation{0.0};
          switch (stock.risk_level()) {
              case 1: // Low risk
                  allocation = low_risk_count > 0 ? wallet.strategy().low_risk_allocation() / 100.0 / low_risk_count : 0;
                  break;
              case 2: // Medium risk
                  allocation = med_risk_count > 0 ? wallet.strategy().medium_risk_allocation() / 100.0 / med_risk_count : 0;
                  break;
              case 3: // High risk
                  allocation = high_risk_count > 0 ? wallet.strategy().high_risk_allocation() / 100.0 / high_risk_count : 0;
                  break;
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  **Optimized Approach**:
  Stock initialization and risk level calculation are handled in a single loop:

  ```cpp
  std::vector<Stock> stocks;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < stock_names.size(); ++i) {
      Stock stock(stock_names[i], expected_returns[i], 0, 0, initial_values[i]);
      stock.calculate_risk_level(variances[i], stock_counter);
      stock.calculate_volatility(variances[i]);
      stocks.push_back(stock);
  }
  ```

## 3. **Encapsulation and Modularization**

- Consolidated logic into the `MarketSimulator::Preparation()` method, replacing the `prepareStockAllocations()` function, enhancing modularity and clarity.
- Integrated preparation, simulation, and output phases into a unified `runSimulator()` method, streamlining the simulation process and improving organization.
- Moved the distribution initialization outside of loops to avoid redundant reinitializations:

  ```cpp
  std::normal_distribution<double> dist(daily_mean, daily_vol);
  ```
